# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed

* The `bindgen` feature is now implemented in `fitsio-sys` rather than `fitsio`. This is done as the bindings generation is really part of `fitsio-sys` rather than `fitsio`. There should be no external difference noticed.

### Removed

* `fitsio-sys-bindgen` is no longer used. It has been merged with `fitsio-sys`.

## [0.21.1]
### Added
### Changed

* `fitsio`: update versions of `fitsio-sys` and `fitsio-sys-bindgen` to pick up latest changes
* `fitsio-sys`: do not specify the version for msys2 since it is not well represented

### Removed

## [0.21.0]
### Added

* The abillity to create a `FitsFile` struct from a `fitsio_sys::fitsfile` pointer [#195](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/195)
* Support for boolean header card values
* `fitsio-sys` (whichever feature is used) is exposed as `fitsio::sys` to make sure that only one crate that links to the system library exists [#195](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/174)

### Changed

* **BREAKING CHANGE** the previously public field `filename` on `FitsFile` has been removed, since:
  * it is now optional,
  * it is not used internally for much, and
  * it is state that does not need to be part of `fitsio`. [#195](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/174)
* Some more types are deriving `Eq` thanks to a clippy lint
* Fixed broken tests on m1 macos [#174](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/174)
* Minimum cfitsio version of 3.37 specified for compilation [#184](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/184)

## [0.20.0]
### Added

* Initial support for windows msys2 [#150](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/150)

### Changed

* Specify version dependencies more specifically which should make installations more reliable, see [this post](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/psa-please-specify-precise-dependency-versions-in-cargo-toml/71277/9) [#151](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/151)
* Pin `ndarray` against versions 0.15.*. This prevents downstream users from
  having interoperability problems when `ndarray` updates to 0.16.0.

## [0.19.0]
### Added

* Added support for 16 bit images and tables thanks @emaadparacha
  [#148](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/148).

### Changed

* arm32 architectures are tested on CI so consider arm32 a tier 1 platform -
  `fitsio` will not release a new version without arm32 tests passing on CI.

### Removed

## [0.18.0]
### Added

* Added support for arm32 architectures (armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf - e.g. Raspberry Pi). This is not tested on CI so it's not maintained as such.

### Changed
### Removed

## [0.17.0]

### Added

* Added support for compiling `cfitsio` from source rather than using the
  bundled version. This requires the installer needing to include the
  dependencies that are required for installing `cfitsio`, namely `make` and
  `gcc`, thanks @cjordan. [#130](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/130)

### Changed

* (`fitsio-derive`) corrected path to `FitsHdu`, release v0.2.0

### Removed

## [0.16.0]

### Added

* (`fitsio`) expose the HDU number (`number`) in the `FitsHdu` struct
* (`fitsio`) handle the 'X' fits column data type. This may not match the
  behaviour with cfitsio, but that behaviour is also seemingly complicated and
  suboptimal; see [#122](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/122)
  for discussion.

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) many small things, including using Rust 2018 edition.

### Removed

## [0.15.0]

### Added

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) **BREAKING CHANGE**: implementing underlying raw `fitsfile` pointer as a `std::ptr::NonNull`, meaning the pointer is guaranteed to never be null, increasing the safety of the API. The breaking change is that more methods require a mutable (exclusive) reference (due to the method of converting the `NonNull` to mutable pointer, required by some lower level methods). The upside is that the `FitsFile` object *should* have exclusive access as it wraps the state of the fits file on disk. Safe concurrent (though not parallel) access is given by the `threadsafe` method.

### Removed


## [0.14.1]

### Added

* (`fitsio`) add boolean column type
* (`fitsio`) add threadsafe version of a `FitsFile` [#99](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/99)
* (`fitsio`) add benchmarking [#98](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/98)
* (`fitsio`) add support for writing all integer header keys

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) fix errors with the system allocator, ensuring the package will run on the latest nightly and beta compilers [#100](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/100)

### Removed

## [0.14.0] - 2018-04-21

### Added

* (`fitsio`) add `overwrite` method to `NewFitsFile` [#94](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/94)
* (`fitsio`) add `ndarray` support [#92](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/92)
* (`fitsio`) add lots of documentation

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) **BREAKING CHANGE**: move code into more logical submodule arrangement [#95](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/95)
* (`fitsio`) add long cfitsio function names internally [#88](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/88)

### Removed

## [0.13.0] - 2018-03-10

### Addded

* (`fitsio`) add `primary_hdu` method [#77](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/77)

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) **BREAKING CHANGE**: changed ImageType variants to be more rusty [#84](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/84)
* (`fitsio`) `create_image` and `create_table` take `Into<String>` [#81](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/81)
* (`fitsio`) `WritesKey::write_key` now accepts &str's as well as `String`s [#80](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/80)
* (`fitsio`) **BREAKING CHANGE**: all ranges are now exclusive of the upper value, matching Rust's default behaviour [#61](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/61)
* (`fitsio`) **BREAKING CHANGE**: inverted the order of image/region axes to match the C row-major convention [#59](https://github.com/simonrw/rust-fitsio/pull/59)

### Removed

## [0.12.1] - 2018-02-23

_Fix issue with uploading crate_

### Addded
### Changed
### Removed

## [0.12.0] - 2018-02-23

### Addded

* (`fitsio`) add support for images which are not 2d
* (`fitsio`) add support for customising the primary HDU when a file is created (Thanks [@astrojhgu](https://users.rust-lang.org/u/astrojhgu) from the users discourse, for the suggestion)
* (`fitsio`) add support for non-2d images
* (`fitsio`) more friendly errors when image data is requested outside of the range of the image

### Changed

* (`fitsio`) change function arguments that were previously `start` and `end` to a `range` `Range<usize>`
* (`fitsio`) removed builder pattern for construction of `ColumnDataDescription`
* (`fitsio`) some implementations which were previously nightly-only have been used. These features involve the `cloned` method on an `Iterator`. Therefore the version of rust is therefore restricted by this.
